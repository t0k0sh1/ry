# KNOWLEDGE.md

Accumulated lessons from PR reviews, implementation work, debugging,
and planning. This file is the project's long-term memory — things that
are not obvious from reading the code but that future contributors
(human or AI) should know.

**Search**: Use `grep -nE` on this file. Each entry has a `**Tags**:`
line for fast lookup, e.g.:

```bash
grep -nE '\*\*Tags\*\*:.*testing' KNOWLEDGE.md
grep -nE '\*\*Tags\*\*:.*codegen' KNOWLEDGE.md
```

**Writing rules**:

- English is preferred (so CodeRabbit / Codex / GitHub search can use it)
- One entry per non-obvious lesson, not per PR
- Each entry must be actionable — state the rule or the fact clearly
- Include a `Source` line (PR number, issue, commit, or `implementation`)
  so future readers can verify context
- Keep entries short (5-15 lines). Link out to code / docs for details

## Testing

### Every new rejection branch needs a test that triggers it directly

**Source**: #841 PR review (CodeRabbit, 2026-04-10)
**Tags**: testing, tdd, codegen-error, regression

**Context**: In #841, `@parallel for` gained a new check that rejects
writes to module globals (`src/codegen_stmt_loop.cpp:345-347`). The
committed tests only covered **legal shadowing** cases
(`ParallelForNestedLoopVarShadowsModuleGlobal`,
`ParallelForInFunctionBodyAllowsShadowOfModuleGlobal`). The rejection
branch itself was never executed by any test, so CodeRabbit flagged
it as a major issue: the branch could silently regress.

**Rule**: When you add a `codegenError(...)` / `parserError(...)` /
`return std::nullopt` / any validation check, you MUST add a
regression test whose input directly triggers that error. Happy-path
tests of adjacent legal cases do NOT count as coverage of the
rejection branch.

**How to verify before opening a PR**:

```bash
git diff origin/<base> -- 'src/**' 'include/**' \
  | grep -nE '^\+.*(codegenError|parserError|return std::nullopt)'
```

For each hit, confirm a test exists that executes that exact line.

## Codegen

### Canonicalization that may collapse shape must be handled at all call sites

**Source**: #844 PR review (CodeRabbit, critical)
**Tags**: codegen, canonicalization, union, types

**Context**: `flattenUnionWithAliases("A | int")` where
`type A = int` collapses to just `"int"`. Downstream `wrapInUnion`
then did `union_type_info_.find("int")`, missed, and dereferenced
`end()`. The fix was to early-return when the flattened result is
no longer a non-literal union.

**Rule**: When introducing a normalization/canonicalization step that
can change a type's **category** (union → scalar, variadic → single,
tuple → element, alias → target), audit every caller that assumes the
original category. Add an explicit early-return for the collapsed case.

**How to verify**:

```bash
grep -n '<normalizer_name>' src/
```

For each hit ask "what if the result is no longer a union/variadic/
tuple?". If the caller indexes a map keyed on the original category,
it needs a guard.

### valueToString element loads must propagate metadata via propagateTypeMeta

**Source**: #811/#836/#810 sweep (2026-04-10, implementation)
**Tags**: codegen, formatter, metadata, collection, nested

**Context**: The formatter in `src/codegen_tostring.cpp` iterates over
`List` / `Map` / `Set` elements by loading them from the container's
data array. Each load yields a fresh SSA `Value*` with no metadata. If
the element type is itself a collection (e.g. `Map<str, List<int>>`),
calling `valueToString(elem)` without propagating the inner type name
falls through to the raw string-pointer path and prints empty strings or
garbage bytes. The `List` branch already had this propagation
(`list_elem_type_name` + `list_elem_fn_type_info` snapshot), but the
`Map` and `Set` branches did not — which is why #811 / #810 went
undetected until this sweep.

**Rule**: Whenever you add a new outer container type to
`valueToString()`, the element-load block MUST:

1. Snapshot both the element type name and any `*_fn_type_info` field
   from the outer container's metadata **before** calling
   `getOrCreateMeta()` (which may rehash `value_metadata_` and
   invalidate pointers).
2. Call `propagateTypeMeta(elemTypeName, elem)` to rebuild the element's
   collection metadata (`list_elem`, `map_value_type_name`, etc.).
3. If the snapshot had `*_fn_type_info`, store it on the element's
   metadata so closures format as `<closure>`.

The union-variant branch needs the same pattern — see the post-#836
code in `codegen_tostring.cpp:200-230`.

**How to verify before opening a PR**:

```bash
grep -nE 'CreateLoad.*elem|CreateLoad.*valVal' src/codegen_tostring.cpp
```

For each hit, confirm that a metadata snapshot + `propagateTypeMeta`
call follows within ~5 lines, or that the outer container has no
corresponding `*_type_name` metadata slot (e.g. fixed-length arrays).

### wrapInUnion must disambiguate same-LLVM-type variants by metadata

**Source**: #836 sweep (discovered while fixing union collection variants)
**Tags**: codegen, union, variant-dispatch, collection, metadata

**Context**: `src/codegen_match.cpp::wrapInUnion` originally picked the
first variant whose LLVM type matched the value's LLVM type. For unions
like `List<int> | Map<str, int>` this always picks the first variant
because both are `ptrTy_`, so a `Map` value gets wrapped with tag=0
(List) and is then interpreted as a List at dispatch time, producing
garbage output. This bug was invisible before #836 because the formatter
rejected collection variants entirely.

**Rule**: When matching a value to a union component, resolve in three
passes: (1) reconstruct the full source-level type name from the value's
metadata via `buildTypeNameFromMeta()` and match it against
`componentNames` exactly — this handles same-kind variants like
`List<int> | List<str>`; (2) fall back to coarse kind match
(`isListTypeName` / `isMapTypeName` / `isSetTypeName` /
`isFunctionTypeName`) against the same metadata fields — this handles
cases where the canonical name couldn't be built (literals without
annotations, aliases); (3) fall back to LLVM-type equality. The value's
`CodeGen::ValueMetadata` fields (`list_elem`, `list_elem_type_name`,
`map_key` / `map_value` / `map_value_type_name`, `set_elem` /
`set_elem_type_name`, `fn_type_info`) are the source of truth.

**How to apply**: Any future dispatch that uses LLVM type equality to
route between ptr-backed Ry types must first consult the metadata.
`src/codegen_match.cpp::wrapInUnion()` and the
`buildTypeNameFromMeta()` helper in `src/codegen_builtin.cpp` are the
canonical pattern.

### %.17g roundtrip precision would break existing float tests

**Source**: #808 sweep (Plan phase, 2026-04-10)
**Tags**: formatter, float, precision, tests

**Context**: A natural fix for #808 ("`print(3.0)` should print `3.0`")
is to switch the `float` formatter to `%.17g` (IEEE 754 roundtrip-safe
precision, same as Python). But IEEE 754 stores `3.14` as
`3.1400000000000001…`, so `%.17g` produces `"3.1400000000000001"`,
breaking every existing test that asserts `to_str(3.14) == "3.14"`
(several in `tests/spec/*.test.ry` and `tests/test_codegen*.cpp`).

**Rule**: The float formatter uses `%g` (= `%.6g`) and appends `".0"`
only when the result has no decimal point, no exponent, and is not
`nan`/`inf`. Roundtrip-safe display is a separate concern and should
be introduced as an explicit opt-in (e.g. `to_str_exact(x)`), not by
changing the default `%g` precision.

**How to apply**: Do not change `%g` → `%.17g` in
`__ry_fmt_float` (runtime_any.cpp) or elsewhere without also planning
to update every float test assertion.

### New primitive types must be wired into every type-reflection site

**Source**: #825 PR review (CodeRabbit, 4 comments)
**Tags**: codegen, primitive-type, type-reflection, generics

**Context**: #825 added `Type` primitive + `type_of` builtin. The
main codegen path worked but `reverseResolveType()`, `inferTypeArgs()`
(`src/codegen_fn_generic.cpp`), and `inferExprType()` (lambda
call-site inference) were not updated. Lambdas like
`(x: int) => type_of(x)` inferred their return as `i64`, and generic
inference collapsed `Type` to `any`.

**Rule**: When adding a new primitive type, grep for existing
primitives and update every site. Common sites to check:
`reverseResolveType`, `inferExprType`, `inferTypeArgs`, `resolveType`,
pretty printers, docs type tables.

**How to verify**:

```bash
grep -nE 'i64Ty_|boolTy_|strTy_|f64Ty_' src/ include/
```

The new type should appear wherever these existing primitives do
(justify any exceptions explicitly).

## Parser / Lexer

### Use depth-tracking for nested delimiters, never naive find()

**Source**: #801 PR
**Tags**: parser, lexer, delimiters

**Context**: `parseFnTypeAnnotation()` originally used
`string::find(')')` to locate the closing paren, which broke on
nested function-typed parameters like
`function((int) -> int) -> int`.

**Rule**: When scanning for a matching closing delimiter (`)`, `]`,
`}`), always use a depth counter that increments on the opening and
decrements on the closing. Never use `string::find(')')` or similar.
Reuse `CodeGen::findMatchingCloseParen()` in `src/codegen_type.cpp`
as the canonical helper.

## Documentation

### Example code in docs must match the current Ry syntax

**Source**: #825 PR review (CodeRabbit)
**Tags**: documentation, syntax

**Context**: #825 docs used `val x: i32 = 1` — the `val` keyword does
not exist in Ry; the actual syntax is `x: i32 = 1`. The snippet was
written from memory (probably by analogy to Scala/Kotlin) and never
verified.

**Rule**: When writing doc examples, don't rely on memory. Either
(a) copy a working example from an existing `tests/spec/*.test.ry`, or
(b) verify the snippet with `./build/ry -c '...'` before committing.

**How to verify**: in `docs/reference/` PRs, grep for keywords that
don't exist in Ry's lexer:

```bash
grep -nE '\bval\b|\bvar\b|\bpublic\b|\bprivate\b' docs/reference/*.md
```

## Commands / Environment gotchas

This section records command/environment mistakes that were
non-obvious to diagnose. Add an entry whenever you iterate on a
command and the second invocation finally works — if the fix was not
trivial, record it so the same mistake isn't repeated.

### Record corrected command invocations (meta-rule)

**Source**: implementation experience (ongoing)
**Tags**: commands, environment, tooling, meta

**Rule**: When a command turns out to be wrong (bad flag, wrong path,
missing env var, outdated syntax) and you find the correct form, add
an entry below with a `Wrong → Correct → Why` triple. Examples of
what qualifies:

- forgetting `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_container_overflow=0` on
  `build-asan/ry_tests`
- forgetting `RY_ENV=internal` when running a globally-installed `ry`
- calling `gh pr view` without `--repo` in a fork context
- using a wrong `cmake --preset` name
- heredoc / quoting / escaping mistakes in shell snippets

Skip: plain typos and mistakes that anyone would catch immediately.

**How to add a new entry**: every time you iterate on a command and
the second invocation works, ask "was the fix non-obvious?". If yes,
write a 3-line entry under this section with a descriptive subheading.

## Review feedback patterns

Meta-entries linking recurring reviewer comments to the specific
rules above. Useful for `grep` when triaging a new review comment —
if a reviewer's comment matches one of these patterns, jump to the
linked rule.

> **Format exception**: entries in this section are pointers into
> other sections, not standalone lessons, so they intentionally use a
> lighter structure (`Tags` + `Seen in` + `Points to`) instead of the
> full `Source` / `Tags` / `Context` / `Rule` layout. Each entry still
> has a `**Tags**:` line so the tag-search convention works uniformly.
