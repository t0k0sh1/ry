# KNOWLEDGE.md

Accumulated lessons from PR reviews, implementation work, debugging,
and planning. This file is the project's long-term memory — things that
are not obvious from reading the code but that future contributors
(human or AI) should know.

**Search**: Use `grep -nE` on this file. Each entry has a `**Tags**:`
line for fast lookup, e.g.:

```bash
grep -nE '\*\*Tags\*\*:.*testing' KNOWLEDGE.md
grep -nE '\*\*Tags\*\*:.*codegen' KNOWLEDGE.md
```

**Writing rules**:

- English is preferred (so CodeRabbit / Codex / GitHub search can use it)
- One entry per non-obvious lesson, not per PR
- Each entry must be actionable — state the rule or the fact clearly
- Include a `Source` line (PR number, issue, commit, or `implementation`)
  so future readers can verify context
- Keep entries short (5-15 lines). Link out to code / docs for details

## Testing

### Every new rejection branch needs a test that triggers it directly

**Source**: #841 PR review (CodeRabbit, 2026-04-10)
**Tags**: testing, tdd, codegen-error, regression

**Context**: In #841, `@parallel for` gained a new check that rejects
writes to module globals (`src/codegen_stmt_loop.cpp:345-347`). The
committed tests only covered **legal shadowing** cases
(`ParallelForNestedLoopVarShadowsModuleGlobal`,
`ParallelForInFunctionBodyAllowsShadowOfModuleGlobal`). The rejection
branch itself was never executed by any test, so CodeRabbit flagged
it as a major issue: the branch could silently regress.

**Rule**: When you add a `codegenError(...)` / `parserError(...)` /
`return std::nullopt` / any validation check, you MUST add a
regression test whose input directly triggers that error. Happy-path
tests of adjacent legal cases do NOT count as coverage of the
rejection branch.

**How to verify before opening a PR**:

```bash
git diff origin/<base> -- 'src/**' 'include/**' \
  | grep -nE '^\+.*(codegenError|parserError|return std::nullopt)'
```

For each hit, confirm a test exists that executes that exact line.

## Codegen

### Canonicalization that may collapse shape must be handled at all call sites

**Source**: #844 PR review (CodeRabbit, critical)
**Tags**: codegen, canonicalization, union, types

**Context**: `flattenUnionWithAliases("A | int")` where
`type A = int` collapses to just `"int"`. Downstream `wrapInUnion`
then did `union_type_info_.find("int")`, missed, and dereferenced
`end()`. The fix was to early-return when the flattened result is
no longer a non-literal union.

**Rule**: When introducing a normalization/canonicalization step that
can change a type's **category** (union → scalar, variadic → single,
tuple → element, alias → target), audit every caller that assumes the
original category. Add an explicit early-return for the collapsed case.

**How to verify**:

```bash
grep -n '<normalizer_name>' src/
```

For each hit ask "what if the result is no longer a union/variadic/
tuple?". If the caller indexes a map keyed on the original category,
it needs a guard.

### New primitive types must be wired into every type-reflection site

**Source**: #825 PR review (CodeRabbit, 4 comments)
**Tags**: codegen, primitive-type, type-reflection, generics

**Context**: #825 added `Type` primitive + `type_of` builtin. The
main codegen path worked but `reverseResolveType()`, `inferTypeArgs()`
(`src/codegen_fn_generic.cpp`), and `inferExprType()` (lambda
call-site inference) were not updated. Lambdas like
`(x: int) => type_of(x)` inferred their return as `i64`, and generic
inference collapsed `Type` to `any`.

**Rule**: When adding a new primitive type, grep for existing
primitives and update every site. Common sites to check:
`reverseResolveType`, `inferExprType`, `inferTypeArgs`, `resolveType`,
pretty printers, docs type tables.

**How to verify**:

```bash
grep -nE 'i64Ty_|boolTy_|strTy_|f64Ty_' src/ include/
```

The new type should appear wherever these existing primitives do
(justify any exceptions explicitly).

## Parser / Lexer

### Use depth-tracking for nested delimiters, never naive find()

**Source**: #801 PR
**Tags**: parser, lexer, delimiters

**Context**: `parseFnTypeAnnotation()` originally used
`string::find(')')` to locate the closing paren, which broke on
nested function-typed parameters like
`function((int) -> int) -> int`.

**Rule**: When scanning for a matching closing delimiter (`)`, `]`,
`}`), always use a depth counter that increments on the opening and
decrements on the closing. Never use `string::find(')')` or similar.
Reuse `CodeGen::findMatchingCloseParen()` in `src/codegen_type.cpp`
as the canonical helper.

## Documentation

### Example code in docs must match the current Ry syntax

**Source**: #825 PR review (CodeRabbit)
**Tags**: documentation, syntax

**Context**: #825 docs used `val x: i32 = 1` — the `val` keyword does
not exist in Ry; the actual syntax is `x: i32 = 1`. The snippet was
written from memory (probably by analogy to Scala/Kotlin) and never
verified.

**Rule**: When writing doc examples, don't rely on memory. Either
(a) copy a working example from an existing `tests/spec/*.test.ry`, or
(b) verify the snippet with `./build/ry -c '...'` before committing.

**How to verify**: in `docs/reference/` PRs, grep for keywords that
don't exist in Ry's lexer:

```bash
grep -nE '\bval\b|\bvar\b|\bpublic\b|\bprivate\b' docs/reference/*.md
```

## Commands / Environment gotchas

This section records command/environment mistakes that were
non-obvious to diagnose. Add an entry whenever you iterate on a
command and the second invocation finally works — if the fix was not
trivial, record it so the same mistake isn't repeated.

### Record corrected command invocations (meta-rule)

**Source**: implementation experience (ongoing)
**Tags**: commands, environment, tooling, meta

**Rule**: When a command turns out to be wrong (bad flag, wrong path,
missing env var, outdated syntax) and you find the correct form, add
an entry below with a `Wrong → Correct → Why` triple. Examples of
what qualifies:

- forgetting `ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_container_overflow=0` on
  `build-asan/ry_tests`
- forgetting `RY_ENV=internal` when running a globally-installed `ry`
- calling `gh pr view` without `--repo` in a fork context
- using a wrong `cmake --preset` name
- heredoc / quoting / escaping mistakes in shell snippets

Skip: plain typos and mistakes that anyone would catch immediately.

**How to add a new entry**: every time you iterate on a command and
the second invocation works, ask "was the fix non-obvious?". If yes,
write a 3-line entry under this section with a descriptive subheading.

## Review feedback patterns

Meta-entries linking recurring reviewer comments to the specific
