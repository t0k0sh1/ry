# Rust Development Standards

## Code Quality Requirements

When implementing or modifying Rust code, you must ensure the code is properly formatted and passes all linter checks before completion.

### Formatting

All Rust code must be formatted using `cargo fmt`. Run the following command after implementing changes:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

All Rust code must pass clippy checks without errors or warnings. Run the following command after implementing changes:

```bash
cargo clippy
```

### Final Verification

Before completing any implementation or modification of Rust files:

1. Run `cargo fmt` to format the code
2. Run `cargo clippy` to check for linting issues
3. Ensure there are no errors or warnings
4. Only mark the task as complete when the code is properly formatted and passes all lint checks

The codebase must be in a clean state with zero errors and zero warnings from both rustfmt and clippy.
