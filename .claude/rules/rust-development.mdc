# Rust Development Standards

## Code Quality Requirements

When implementing or modifying Rust code, you must ensure the code is properly formatted and passes all linter checks before completion.

### Formatting

All Rust code must be formatted using `cargo fmt`. Run the following command after implementing changes:

```bash
cargo fmt
```

### Linting

All Rust code must pass clippy checks without errors or warnings. Run the following command after implementing changes:

```bash
cargo clippy
```

### Testing

All Rust code must include appropriate tests and pass all test cases. Write tests for:

- Unit tests for individual functions and modules
- Integration tests for complete features and workflows
- Edge cases and error conditions

Run the following command to execute tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

All tests must pass before considering the implementation complete.

### Final Verification

Before completing any implementation or modification of Rust files:

1. Write appropriate tests for the implemented functionality
2. Run `cargo test` to ensure all tests pass
3. Run `cargo fmt` to format the code
4. Run `cargo clippy` to check for linting issues
5. Ensure there are no errors or warnings
6. Only mark the task as complete when the code is properly formatted, passes all lint checks, and all tests pass

The codebase must be in a clean state with zero errors and zero warnings from both rustfmt and clippy, and all tests must pass.
