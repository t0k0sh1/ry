# Stdlib Package Additions

### Bare `@native` vs `@native("pkg")` — NOT cosmetically equivalent

**Source**: #907 / PR #901 review (+ self-test regression during fix)
**Tags**: stdlib, @native, codegen, native-library, review-feedback-patterns

The two forms differ in a critical way beyond codegen dispatch:

- `@native("pkg")` sets `sig.library = "pkg"`, which populates
  `native_lib_index_`. At runtime the JIT attempts to **dlopen
  `libry_<pkg>.*`** based on this index.
- Bare `@native` leaves `sig.library` empty, so no library loading is
  triggered.

For dispatch key calculation (`effectivePackage`), both forms produce the
same key because `deriveNativePackage()` extracts the package name from
the file path regardless of the directive argument. So codegen dispatch
is identical.

**But**: if the package is **entirely** handled by a custom codegen
emitter (like `math`, whose functions are emitted as LLVM IR inline) and
has **no separate `libry_<pkg>.dylib`**, using `@native("pkg")` will
cause a runtime "native library not found" error.

**Rule**: Use bare `@native` (no argument) for stdlib packages whose
functions are all handled by custom codegen emitters and have no
separate shared library. Use `@native("pkg")` only when the package
has a corresponding `libry_<pkg>.*` shared library built via
`add_ry_native_lib()`.

### `Match` type is registered programmatically in codegen, not via a `record` declaration in regex.ry

**Source**: #830 (2026-04-14, implementation)
**Tags**: regex, record-type, codegen, stdlib-design

**Rule**: The `Match` type (`{full: str, groups: List<str>}`) used as the element type of
`find_all`'s return value is registered in `record_types_` inside the `CodeGen` constructor
(same pattern as `Error`), not declared as a `record` in `share/std/regex.ry`.

**Why**: If `Match` were declared in `regex.ry`, it would only be registered when a user
explicitly imports it (e.g., `from regex import Match, find_all`). Omitting `Match` from the
import would cause codegen to silently fail to find the type in `record_types_` when it tries
to tag the `find_all` result. By registering it unconditionally at construction time (same as
`Error`), users can write `from regex import find_all` without importing `Match` and still get
the fully-typed `List<Match>` result, including field access via `.full` and `.groups`.

**How to apply**: When a stdlib function returns a record type and that type must be available
regardless of explicit import, register it programmatically in the `CodeGen` constructor
alongside `Error`. If instead the type should only be available on explicit import (e.g., a
user-facing constructor), define it in the `.ry` file as a normal `record`.
